    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Susan Fenton</h2>
    <p>I am taking this class to learn about Web design.  
        My husband and I would like to start a Web Design busines.
    </p>
    <p>I live in northeastern Ohio about an hour south of Kirtland. 
        I am orginally from Idaho and I love the mountains, 
        but is am leaning to the beauty that is here in Ohio.  
        It's not mountains, but the forests here are beautiful.  I love
        running in them. Some of my hobbies are trail running, reading,
         and listening to podcasts-especially ones related to history.

    </p>
    <p> I am married with two children--a son and a daughter.  My son is married and he and his wife have a beautiful
        fifteen month old daughter.  I love being a grandmother.  My daughter is a senior in high school.  She is so 
        busy with all her activities that I don't get to see her much.
    </p>
    <p>I am looking forward to meeting everyone in this class.</p>
